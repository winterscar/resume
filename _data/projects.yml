- project: Target
  technologies: Canvas Apps, Model Driven Apps, React, Svelte, C#, Azure Functions, PCF, Custom Connectors, DevOps
  role: Lead Consultant, Architect
  duration: 1 year (ongoing)
  description: |
      An internal Front-End tool for managing AI generated 'Matches' between clients and lots.
      With a heavy focus on design, performance and correctness from very demanding stakeholders, Target required every tool in the bag.
      From custom built PCF controls to enhance built in PowerApp functionality (JavaScript Events triggering, Absolute Positioning, drop-in HTML replacements)
      or to replace entire screens, through to custom C# back-ends for data-processing and integration with On-Prem databases.
      Target required a great deal of on-the-fly target solving to push the power platform past its limits, whilst managing client expectations, a delivery team
      and budget.

- project: Power Platform Governance & Security setup
  technologies: Power Automate, CoE Starter Kit, Power BI
  role: Lead Consultant, Architect
  duration: Various (~ 6 months each)
  description: | 
      Consulted with a variety large-size organizations (20k+ users) to formulate an effective governance policy for their power platform.
      Created Documentation and tooling to enforce policies, worked with Adoption and Change Management teams to coordinate effective adoption
      and rollout strategies, and worked with internal departments (IT, Security, Licensing) to validate proposed strategies against wider organizational policies.

- project: Power Platform Application Lifecycle Management
  technologies: Azure Devops, Pipelines, GitHub, PowerShell, Canvas Apps
  role: Lead Developer
  duration: Various (~ 2 months)
  description: |
      Produced functional Application Lifecycle Management strategies and associated tooling for a variety of large customers.
      Before the Creation of Microsoft's ALM4PP solution, I produced custom DevOps tooling to facilitate the deployment of Power Platform solutions,
      driven by the dual needs of effective developer collaboration and production environment governance.
      Since the release of ALM4PP, I have configured and customized this process as per client and project requirements, producing documentation,
      policies, and additional tooling. One major customization was the migration of the ALM4PP solution from an Azure DevOps backend to Github to facilitate
      compliance with existing source control policies.

- project: DLP Calculator
  technologies: Dataverse, Clojure, Azure Functions
  role: Sole Developer
  duration: 1 week
  description:  |
     Produced a Clojure webserver to calculate potential conflicts when making changes to a DLP policy. Reads in data from dataverse,
     along with a 'proposed policy', and outputs a list of affected apps and flows. Designed to be integrated into a DLP Change request pipeline,
     runs hosted in an Azure Function

- project: New Project Tool
  technologies: PowerShell, Pipelines, Power Automate, Canvas Apps
  role: Lead Developer
  duration: 4 months
  description: |
      Developed a 'New Project Tool' for advanced Power Platform Developers. The New Project tool allows advanced makers to get started on a new 
      Power Platform project without needing to manually provision resources. The NPT allows users to submit a new project request using very simple
      language (what connectors will this project use, how will you manage user permissions), the results of which are transformed into a provisioning plan
      which, (subject to approval), is implemented using PowerShell scripts running in an Azure DevOps pipeline.
      Links to all generated resources are then returned to the user once provisioning is complete. The NPT provisions some combination of the following resources
      subject to project requirements:
      <ul>
        <li>Power Platform Environments & DLP Policies</li>
        <li>Git Repos with branch policies</li>
        <li>Azure Devops permissions, backlogs, teams</li>
        <li>ALM4PP deployment profiles for each developer</li>
        <li>Service Accounts</li>
        <li>AD Groups</li>
        <li>Initialized solution template</li>
        <li>Deployment Pipelines</li>
      </ul>

- project: TAB (The Architecture Board)
  technologies: Canvas Apps, SharePoint
  role: Lead Developer, Consultant
  duration: 4 months
  description: |
      Developed a replacement architecture approval process, moving from Nintex Forms to Power Platform. However, instead of simply migrating the
      existing workflow to PP, I worked with the Architecture team to understand the value derived from the process, and re-designed a new, significantly
      simpler process. The combination of a new process and tool meant that architecture requests could be submitted 5x faster, and approved 100x faster in some cases!
